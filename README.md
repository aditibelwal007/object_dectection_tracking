# object_dectection_tracking
This project focuses on detecting and tracking multiple objects in real time using deep learning models and computer vision techniques. It identifies objects from a live video stream or video file and assigns unique IDs to track their movement frame by frame.
🎯 Object Detection & Tracking System
Real-Time AI-Powered Object Detection and Multi-Object Tracking

This project focuses on detecting and tracking multiple objects in real time using deep learning models and computer vision techniques. It identifies objects from a live video stream or video file and assigns unique IDs to track their movement frame by frame.

✨ Features
🧠 Detects multiple objects in real time (e.g., people, cars, animals)

🔍 Assigns unique IDs to track objects across frames

📷 Supports video files, live webcam feed, or CCTV streams

⚡ Fast and accurate — powered by pre-trained deep learning models (YOLO, SSD, etc.)

🧭 Visual bounding boxes and tracking lines for clarity

💾 Optional: Count objects, save footage, or trigger alerts
